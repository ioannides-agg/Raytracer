# Raytracer

This project is a work-in-progress implementation of a raytracer. It has been heavily altered over the months as I have grown as a programmer, applying new concepts and adopting different approaches to tackle the same problem. The raytracer is based on the famous *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* e-book:
